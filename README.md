# PHP Logging Project

## Description
This project implements application logging in PHP using the Composer dependency manager and the Monolog library. It demonstrates how to set up logging channels for different log levels, such as informational and error logs.

## Objectives
- Understand the importance of logging in web applications.
- Install and configure Monolog using Composer.
- Set up multiple logging channels for different types of logs.
- Configure PSR-4 autoloading for efficient code organization.
- Log various events and errors to the appropriate channels.

## Implementation
The project consists of the following key components:

- **AppLogger.php**: This file contains the `AppLogger` class, which is responsible for handling logging functionality. It initializes the Monolog logger and defines methods for logging informational and error messages.

- **test_logger.php**: This file is used for testing the logging functionality. It creates an instance of the `AppLogger` and logs sample messages every time the URL is accessed.

- **logs/**: This directory stores the log files generated by the application, including `app.log` and `error.log`.

## Logging Mechanism
Whenever the URL `http://localhost/my-php-logging-project/test_logger.php` is accessed, the following occurs:
- An informational log entry is created indicating that the script has been executed.
- An error log entry is also created, which can be modified based on the needs of the application.

This allows you to see both informational and error logs in real-time as you interact with your application.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical demonstration of logging in PHP applications, showcasing how to leverage Monolog for effective monitoring and debugging.
